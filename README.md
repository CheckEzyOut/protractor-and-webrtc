# Protractor and WebRTC

This project is a code lab to teach the basics for creating end to end tests with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) for [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) applications.

## Sample application

We will use a sample WebRTC application based on the following Google's codelab for all the exercises: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/#8.

### Pre-requirements

- Node.js v6.x.x+ (use this URL to download Node.js in case you don't have it yet: https://nodejs.org/)
- Chrome, Firefox or Opera browser (due to WebRTC compatibility)

## Class 0 - Setup

## Class 1 - First test

## Class 2 - Page object

## Class 3 - Two Browsers (first test)

## Class 4 - Two Browsers (other tests)

## Class 5 - Separating tests
